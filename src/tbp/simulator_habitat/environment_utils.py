def get_bounding_corners(object_ref) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
    """Determine and return the bounding box of a Habitat object.

    Determines and returns the bounding box (defined by a "max" and "min" corner) of
    a Habitat object (such as a mug), given in world coordinates.

    Specifically uses the "axis-aligned bounding box" (aabb) available in Habitat; this
    is a bounding box aligned with the axes of the co-oridante system, which tends to
    be computationally efficient to retrieve.

    Args:
        object_ref : the Habitat object instance

    Returns:
        min_corner and max_corner, the defining corners of the bounding box.
    """
    object_aabb = object_ref.collision_shape_aabb

    # The bounding box will be in the coordinate frame of the object, and so needs to be
    # transformed (rotated and translated) based on the pose of the object in the
    # environment
    # The matrix returned by object_ref.transformation can apply this transformation
    # pointwise to the min and max corner points below
